    "We provide an ETL pipeline that enables parents or realtors helping parents with school age children, who are looking to identify good public-school districts and are sensitive to high home prices. This ETL pipeline allows for analysis of median home prices and school ranking and come up with an optimal township / city school based on a predefined median house price combination. Based on the median house price range, a list of highest ranked schools, are provided across NJ."
